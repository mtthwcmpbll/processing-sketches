#SpeechVisualization

This sketch uses the Voce and Sphinx speech processing libraries in order to show spoken
words one the screen, coloring the words based on their length.  This was an interactive
demonstration to discuss data analysis and visualization techniques with middle schoolers
as part of a program to discuss careers in STEM fields.
